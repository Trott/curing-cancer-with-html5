# Spoiler alert!

*We're not actually going to cure cancer with HTML5...*

???

We're not really curing cancer.

But we are helping *other* people do important work in oncology, public health, law, sociology. 

We're also helping the general public find previously-hidden important information.

# OMG

*False advertising!*

???

But yeah, we're not directly curing cancer here. "omg! false advertising!""

OK, so we can chuckle at that. Let's fast foward now to 1983...

![Letter from Sylvester Stallone agreeing to smoke in his movies in exchange for $500,000.](img/tmq36b00.jpg)

???

Shameful. Absolutely shameful. I mean, every person in this room knows that it ought
to be "no *fewer* than five feature films" and not "no *less* than 5", right?

By the way, $500,000 in 1983 adjusted for inflation is $1,196,501.00 in 2014. To
put that in perspective, that's enough to buy 18,408 HTML5 Dev Conf early bird registrations.

Fast forward again to 2002.

# "Shocked and horrified!"

*The Slow Poisoners*

???

I was in a band called The Slow Poisoners. With *that* name, 
we wanted tobacco industry sponsorship. So we wrote to B&amp;W telling them that we were
(and I quote) "shocked and horrified" that they paid Stallone a half million 
dollars to smoke in movies...because we would be happy to smoke their products on 
stage for much less money than that.

# "Extremely tempting!"

*Brown &amp; Williamson*

???

One of the B&amp;W lawyers must have had a good sense of humor, because he wrote us
back to tell us that our offer was (and, again, I quote) "extremely tempting". 
However, he went on to say, that sort of promotion would put them in violation of something 
called The Master Settlement. So, they had to turn us down.

# Dude, where's your presentation?

What does any of this have to do with the web?

# Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement

Look it up on Wikipedia if you want details.

???

Well, that Master Settlement alluded to by the B&amp;W lawyer had a lot of effects.
But the one we care about here is this...

The Master Settlement ultimately resulted in this site, run by my employer, the
UC San Francisco Library.

*Describe what it contains, who uses it, the technology behind it, limitations of
that tech, and the new improved interface.*

What's wrong in my opinion, not just my opinion but user research showed, here's what our awesome UX designer is trying to do to fix the problem.

Check out the left sidebar on the scoped search pdf in that last link. Hot. Use it.

* Lucene 2, not even SOLR
* Tomcat WAR for everything. Monolithic!
* No incremental indexing
* Metadata in MySQL w/ index build off that; considering using SOLR as data store b/c document-based

Gotta get this in somewhere early where it won't ruin the flow:

This talk isn't about nitty gritty code stuff. (There are, like, 8 other talks you can go to
if that's what you want! I won't take it personally!)

This talk is about user experience for searching and results.

And it's not generalized. It's a case study. I'll talk about what we learned, what we did right, and what we'd do differently.

*Talk about terrible, inflexible Library interfaces (like III) and what we do about it*

*Talk about LTDL2 v. LTDL3?*

*In either event, it's bringing something HTML 4-ish into the modern world.*
