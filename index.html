# Spoiler Alert!

*We're not actually going to cure cancer with HTML5...*

???

We're not really curing cancer.

But we are helping *other* people do important work in oncology, public health, law, sociology.

We're also helping the general public find previously-hidden important information.

# Decision time....

???

*Do we want to talk about terrible, inflexible Library interfaces (like III) and what we do about it?*

*Or do we want to talk about LTDL2 v. LTDL3?*

*In either event, it's bringing something HTML 4-ish into the modern world.*
